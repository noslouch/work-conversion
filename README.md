This is my first script. 

I'm using for presenting costs of a monthly retainer to client to show them how we are spending their money.

There is one primary worker whose hours are used to calculate the hours for 3 other members of a team.

The assignments are based on my own experience doing this kind of work, so this function has pretty limited use. But I wanted an excuse to use github.

Anyway, the maximum number of hours for the central worker is 40 per month. Separately, I assigned a monthly maximum for the other team members (graphic designer, account manager, and product manager). The creative director role is adjusted as well. 

The total adjusted monthly hours is 55. Using the ratio of adjusted hours to actual hours I calculate the actual hours for all the team members. From there I determine the costs to present to the client and print it all out for myself.
